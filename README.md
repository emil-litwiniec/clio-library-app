> Library app

Simple UI library app for searching and managing books.

The name is inspired by the Greek muse of history - "Clio".
She is often represented with an open parchment scroll, a book, or a set of tablets.

## Guide
Usage is easy!

If you want to log as ADMIN, sign in with those  credentials:
```
email address: admin@admin.pl
pass: 12345
```

If you want to log as USER, use these:
```
email address: user@user.pl
pass: 12345
```

Accessing books and users borrows from ADMIN account is possible by finding ID only.</br> ID would be displayed on the book's etiquette or on the user's card, so here are some example IDs:

>Just start typing and suggestions will be displayed simultaneously.

You can also obtain book ID entering search detail for a book. ID is the last element in the URL's path.
## About

Clio is a full feature librarian app with user authentication system providing access for registered users, librarians and unregistered guests.
It consists of React client, Express Rest API and PostgreSQL DB.

Also I wanted to make full grown application as an autonomous entity.

## Features

- Authentication made using Json Web Token with separate routes for: admin, registered user and guest
- Sensitive data such as passwords is secured with hash algorithms
- Advanced search panel with filters 
- API's routes secured with JWT middleware utility
- auto-suggest when searching ID of a book or a user

> ##### Future features 
> 
> This project is created for learning purposes only. It gives basic functionality as it is.

>
> - punishment system for overdue books ( fines system )
> - user notification ( overdue books, reservations, fines, general library announcements)
> - more filter search options
> - scan ID with barcode scanner
> - generating etiquette with barcode for newly added book or for new user's card
> - better bundle optimization with code-splitting, webpack chunks i.e
